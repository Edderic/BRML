Graph Layout Generation Package
Ver 1.0, 08-May-2000
Tested under Linux MATLAB 5.3

This package contains utility functions for drawing
small directed or undirected networks (e.g. textbook examples) 
using Matlab.

For a demo run the scripts 
test_layout.m 
test_layout_dbn.m 

Tip: If the drawing becomes too messy, just resize
the figure and try again. 

I welcome suggestions and/or bug reports.

Note for experts:
There is really not much in the automatic layout generator. 
For directed graphs, I order the nodes topologically and
organize them in layers. For undirected or mixed graphs, I compute 
the layers by partial ordering. All edges are straight lines 
and there is no check for edge crossings. However, for textbook examples, 
(small and/or structured graphs) the results are usually not too bad.
